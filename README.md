*Performed the fundamentals of sentiment analysis, and built a logistic regression model to 
classify movie reviews as either positive or negative. Also used the popular IMDB data set. 
The goal was to use a simple logistic regression estimator from scikit-learn for document classification.*

- Build and employ a logistic regression classifier using scikit-learn.
- Clean and pre-process text data.
- Perform feature extraction with nltk
- Tune model hyperparameters and evaluate model accuracy

*Apply the logistic regression classification algorithm using scikit-learn and 
Python to classify movie reviews as either postive or negative.*
